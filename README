#Haskell Exercises

This repository contains code written in the functional programming language Haskell.
The code was created during the summer term 2020 for the lecture "Programmierung und Modellierung" 
@ LMU Munich and is meant to demonstrate an understanding of the fundamental concepts 
of the Haskell programming language and functional programming as whole.
Therefore the Repository provides code examples on the use of Higher Order Functions,
Functors, Applicatives, Monoids, Monads and Purity.
